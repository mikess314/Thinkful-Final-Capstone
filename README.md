Text Summarization using Scrapy and RNN

Facing an increasingly polarized readership, news publications commonly resort to biased journalism along a sociopolitical spectrum of left or right leaning subjectivity. Websites like Vox and Breitbart News cover many of the same stories, but from entirely different perspectives intended to enhance the confirmation bias of the reader, a proven customer retention strategy. 

A recently created website, [Knowhere](http://www.knowhere.com) attempts to appease both sides and the middle by publishing news stories three ways, with labels of "Impartial", "Left", & "Right" readers can choose from. This is accomplished using a combination of human editors, scraping AI, and NLP machine learning models used to encode and decode the articles according to weights. 

A crucial aspect of the NLP models is the summarization of published news articles. This presents a particular challenge as articles are often 700+ words. Smaller texts, like tweets, comments, and product reviews are often only a few hundred characters presenting a single idea. News articles give backstory, context, and different perspectives (even if only to marginalize that perspective). 

In this capstone I have attempted to create a text summarizer for 3,000 articles published in September and October 2018 on four websites, listed left to right by subjective bias in journalism from left to right Huffington Post, Politico, BBC US, and The Daily Caller.
