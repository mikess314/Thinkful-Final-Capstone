    "# Thinkful Data Science Final Capstone\n",
    "## News Article Summarization Using Keras RNNs\n",
    "\n",
    "Facing an increasingly polarized readership, news publications commonly resort to biased journalism along a sociopolitical spectrum of left or right leaning subjectivity. Websites like Vox and Breitbart News cover many of the same stories, but from entirely different perspectives intended to enhance the confirmation bias of the reader, a proven customer retention strategy. \n",
    "\n",
    "A recently created website, [Knowhere](http://www.knowhere.com) attempts to appease both sides and the middle by publishing news stories three ways, with labels of \"Impartial\", \"Left\", & \"Right\" readers can choose from. This is accomplished using a combination of human editors, scraping AI, and NLP machine learning models used to encode and decode the articles according to weights. \n",
    "\n",
    "A crucial aspect of the NLP models is the summarization of published news articles. This presents a particular challenge as articles are often 700+ words. Smaller texts, like tweets, comments, and product reviews are often only a few hundred characters presenting a single idea. News articles give backstory, context, and different perspectives (even if only to marginalize that perspective). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this capstone I have attempted to create a text summarizer for 3,000 articles published in September and October 2018 on four websites, listed left to right by subjective bias in journalism from left to right Huffington Post, Politico, BBC US, and The Daily Caller. "

Also, the training accuracy continues a very steady rise of 1.5-3% per epoch. This tapered off in the last ten epochs though. So if I were to train again on 60 epochs it very well might have gotten to the 90s. \n",

    "Despite using over a dozen variations of RNNs, GloVe embeddings, Seq2Seq modeling, and a variety of hyperparameter adjustments, some of which were left out of this Notebook, over the course of weeks I can see that the RNN is still encountering great difficulty summarizing against large text files like full news articles. While accuracy increases in the overall training set, validation accuracy improves somewhat, but not nearly enough to summarize the entire article. \n",

    "A potential course of action for future development may be to summarize individual paragraphs or even sentences in articles, combine those summaries into new DataFrames train/test splits and attempt summarizations on the summaries. \n",

    "At the time of this writing Google is days away from releasing a bidirectional transformer system, currently known through its AI paper \"Google BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding\". A bidirectional approach may yield better results than feed-forward designs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, a current trend moving away from RNNs entirely is being promoted by Cornell University in the paper [\"Attention Is All You Need\"](https://arvix.org/abs/170603762). This process declares that using a simpler network architecture, one based solely on attention mechanisms. This is worth investigating as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Text summarization can be used to simplify news articles in ways that semantic analysis does not and potentially be used to create models that compare the objective summaries to the published headlines so to identify sensationalist, \"clickbait\" style journalism. Though this pipeline has not yielded the desired results so far and the time to present as a final capstone has come, I intend to continue working on text summarization as a specialization under the NLP umbrella.
